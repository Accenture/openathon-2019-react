## Creating a new React App

It is possible to manually create a React project, but Facebook has
created a node module **create-react-app** to generate a boilerplate
version of a React application.

> **You’ll need to have Node >= 6 on your local development machine**
> (but it’s not required on the server).  You can use [nvm]
> (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows] to easily switch Node versions
> between different projects.

To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:

[nvm]: https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation
[nvm-windows]: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows

### npx

```sh
npx create-react-app <name-of-app>
```

> [npx] comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older
> npm versions][npm-older].

[npm-older]: https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f

### npm

```sh
npm init react-app <name-of-app>
```

`npm init <initializer>` is available in npm 6+*

> More information about
> [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/)

Inside the newly created project (`name-of-app`), you can run some
built-in commands.

To **run the application** in development mode, execute `npm start`.
In your browser, open http://localhost:3000 to view your running react
application.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
Also, you will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

## Folder structure

When it comes to structuring a React app, the ideal folder
organization is the one that allows you to move around your code with
the least amount of effort.  The folder structure should encourage
scalability, but also reusability and be simple enough for new team
members to quickly get onboard.

After creation, your project should look like this:

```
app/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    App.css
    App.js
    App.test.js
    index.css
    index.js
    logo.svg
```

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact
filenames**:

* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

We are going to delete and rename the other files, to get the
following folder structure:

```
my-app/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    assets/
      images/
        logo.svg
      styles/
        index.css
    components/
      App/
        App.css
        App.js
        App.test.js
    services/
      registerServiceWorker.js
    index.js
```

Don't forget to update the path for the imported files in `App.js` and
`index.js` considering the new folder structure:

```javascript
/* index.js */

import './assets/styles/index.css';
import App from './components/App/App';
import registerServiceWorker from './services/registerServiceWorker';
```

```javascript
/* App.js */

import logo from '../../assets/images/logo.svg';
import './App.css';
```

## Adding a CSS Preprocessor

We will integrate a CSS preprocessor.  _In this lab, we will be using
**Sass**, but you can also use Less, or another alternative_.

Install node-sass:

```sh
npm install node-sass --save-dev
```

Then add the following lines to the `scripts` element in
`package.json`:

```diff
"scripts": {
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject",
+   "sass:watch": "node-sass -w src -o src --output-style compressed",
+   "sass:build": "node-sass src -o src --output-style compressed",
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom"
},
```

To use a different preprocessor, replace the `sass:watch` and the
`sass:build` commands with what's required for your preprocessor of
choice.

_Before running new commands, remember to stop the ejecution of
previous jobs by pressing_ `Ctrl + C`.

1. Create a new `index.scss` file in `scr/assets/styles` to include
   thee generic styles for your application.

2. Run `npm sass:watch` in your terminal.

3. Add the following rules to your `index.scss`:

    ```scss
    /* index.scss */
    body {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        font-family: sans-serif;
    }
    ```

4. Save the changes.

5. The watcher will find every Sass file in `src` subdirectories and
   creates a corresponding CSS file next to it.  You can find a new
   `index.css` file in your styles folder.  Check that your main
   `src/index.js` imports the `index.css` file.  If not, add the
   following line:

    ```javascript
    /* index.js */

    import './assets/styles/index.css';
    ```
	
   Now, create a new file called `App.scss` in your
   `src/components/App` directory, copy and paste all the content from
   the old `App.css` file to the new `App.scss` file and save the
   changes.  The watcher will overrides `App.css`.  Since `App.js`
   still imports `App.css`, the styles become a part of your
   application.

You can now make some changes in `App.scss` and the `App.css` file
will be regenerated.

## How to run multiple concurrently

The usual way to run multiple commands concurrently is the following:

```
npm run <script01> && npm run <script02>
```

That's fine but it's hard to keep on track of different outputs.  Also
if one process fails, others still keep running and you won't even
notice the difference.  Another option would be to just run all
commands in separate terminals.

To make it easy, we will use the `concurrently` library.  To install
it, run the following command:

```sh
npm install -g concurrently
```

Then replace the following lines in `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
    "build": "concurrently \"npm run sass:build\" \"react-scripts build\"",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject",
    "sass:watch": "node-sass -w src -o src --output-style compressed --include-path src",
    "sass:build": "node-sass src -o src --output-style compressed --include-path src",
    "start": "concurrently --kill-others \"npm run sass:watch\" \"react-scripts start\"",
    "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom"
},
```

Now, stop the previous job in your terminal and run:

    npm start

Make some changes in your `App.scss` and save the file.  Your app will
be automatically reloaded and all the changes are visibles in the
browser.  _Test it by adding a `color:red` property to the `.App`
class and saving the changes.  After checking that this is working
properly, remove this property and save again.

> Note: During the next labs, if you get an error because a new css
> file can't be found, stop the execution of the current job and run
> `npm start` again.  Go then to the `.scss` file that the system
> doesn't find and save again to generate the css file.

## Displaying ESLint Output in the Editor

Some editors, including Sublime Text, Atom, and Visual Studio Code,
provide plugins for ESLint whereby you should see the linter output
right in your terminal as well as the browser console.

However, if you prefer the lint results to appear right in your
editor, there are some extra steps you can follow:

1. You would need to install an ESLint plugin for your editor first.

    [Download][eslint-download] the ESLint plugin for Visual Studio
    Code.

2. Then, add a file called `.eslintrc` to the project root:

    ```javascript
    {
      "extends": "react-app"
    }
    ```

    Now your editor should report the linting warnings.

> This feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.0` and higher.  It
> only works with npm 3 or higher.  More information about the [ESLint
> package in Create React App][eslint-package].
