## React Controlled Components

Form elements work in a different way that other DOM elements in React. The traditional HTML form elements (_<input>, <textarea>, and <select>_) maintain their own state and update it based on user input. However, the state of a React component is kept in the state property and only updated with _setState()_ method.
